I have an acoustic to record on, and I think it'll work, but I'm having trouble getting the right sound. How do I get a decent sound out of it without spending what's left of my college fund? I use OpenMPT and Audacity for everything if it helps.

Hey all, a few weeks ago I made a post about my efforts to clear the junk out of my parents' house. Well, fast forward a few weeks, and I am very close to being done!

Lead sheets  acoustic guitar notes which is the best.  Free Online Electric Or Acoustic Guitar Lessons. Hi, I just picked up the original RS (basically to get the Real Tone cable), and I'm waiting on RS 2014 (pretty sure my wife might be picking it up for X-mas). I'm playing through an acoustic-electric because I don't have an electric guitar. It's got me thinking: is the guitar output from Rocksmith at all based on the 'amplified' signal coming from the guitar, or is it totally synthesized based on the tone the game settings call for combined with the note(s) it's detecting? Put another How exactly do the virtual instruments work? Are they more geared towards true EDM or could I make a straight cover of, say, "New Slang" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD7qIthSdkA) by the Shins or "Shake Me Down" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhigpewbg5s) by Cage The Elephant and still have it sound like the original song?

I'm using Mixcraft 8 and using Guitar Rig 5 for guitar effects on a midi piece I'm playing on the keyboard. It's an effect, so what's the best virtual instrument to use to get a good guitar sound? I have acoustic piano loaded as my default instrument and when I add Guitar Rig as an effect it works, but I can still hear the piano underneath the guitar effect. If I'm using Guitar Rig to get a distorted guitar sound, for example, should I be using a guitar virtual instrument? Clean, distorted I'm a guitar player, and I'd like to record some songs on my own but I have barely any experience with drums both physical and virtual. I've used some VSTs for drums but playing them with my keyboard seems pretty hard and using the in built sequencer(ableton). I watched a couple of videos on drum machines and they look great, but i dont know if they can emulate a more acoustic sounding drum.

Just a quick introduction; I'm Mr.Goodhand. Today marks the first day I seriously am considering transitioning to Mixer from Twitch. I started streaming awhile back, on twitch, but found its severe level of over saturation to be.a bit.over the top these days. I made several guides on the twitch sub-reddit involving audio, and I wanted to share them with the mixer community. Utilization of these audio techniques is purely. Mayo Day is a unique special day where people around the world celebrate Mayo. Here‚Äôs the events going on today, May 4th, in Mayo. Majority of the events are free. The theme of the 2019 Mayo Day is ‚ÄúThe Mayo Word‚Äù, representing communities, creativity, and connection to a pride of place both here in this county and around the globe. The Mayo Word will be discussed, celebrated and defined through this Mayo Day campaign culminating in a flagship event taking place at the National Museum I'm an aspiring music maker. I've written a few songs with my acoustic guitar (the only instrument I play) and eventually got a band together to fully realize the songs in it's "full band" version. Through good feedback, I've realized that I have a sort of knack when it comes to making melodies. So I picked up an AKAI MPK Mini II and have settled for Reaper as my go-to DAW. I have successfully hooked it the MIDI keyboard to function with Reaper and learnt how to set up Virtual. I'm looking for some free VST plugins for virtual instruments to compose some work. I'm a total musical amateur. Barely know notes, scales, chords, that sort of thing. but looking to use this as a tool to learn more and try my hand at creating original work. If someone could point me to those VSTs, that'd be really appreciated. Instruments of particular interest are: \ Electric and Acoustic Guitars \ Piano \ Sax \ Flute \ some kind of horn (maybe Clarinet) Hi there! So, first things first, I'm not much of a programmer type of guy, but I like playing around with stuff. I came across a VSTi (virtual instrument) that works great, easy to use, has all sorts of sound modulating stuff, and is put together quite primitively. And so I thought I'd make my own preset library for it, with my own custom sounds. I managed to make custom library entries for it, icons, different categories inside my library, etc., but I'm stuck at referencing my own sounds. For just .99 (instead of 6), get the AcousticSamples 4-in-1 Guitar Bundle (https://audioplugin.deals/) comprising of GD-6 Acoustic Guitar, Strategy, Sunbird and Telematic V3! Acousticsamples creates virtual instruments focused on the perfect recreation of acoustic and electric instrument such as guitars, pianos, organs and more. Originally 6, the whole bundle is now available for just .99 for a limited time only (you save a whopping 6).

From "How My Predictions Are Faring" with all instances of "2009" replaced with "2019". These are all of mid-90s Ray Kurzweil's predictions for 2009, dating back to The Age of Spiritual Machines  It's almost uncanny how precise he was so long as you shift the accuracy by a decade. I'd say roughly 95% of his predictions accurately called the present day. Funnily enough, the ones that missed the mark were the ones he himself said were wrong. His main problem was trying to predict the consumer. 
Hi everyone! I just found this subreddit and it's so nice seeing so many supportive people coming together on all things musically related! Right now I'm in the process of crafting my first EP, and I think I've decided on the songs I want to use! I'm really excited to record the songs, but I've actually run into a roadblock over the past several weeks with regards to the recording process. Im a solo acoustic singer/songwriter in the folk-rock/folk-pop genre, and the "upbeat" songs Two decades of time have slipped through the red, white, and blue palms of the United States. The international geopolitical theatre has suffered massive shifts, and continue to change, effervescently, as well as permanently. The geopolitical theatre, though, becomes gradually more degrading on the senses. Focusing on the starving masses abroad, the rampant instability in hundreds of countries, the homicidal governments of Southeast Asia as a whole, it all gets very tiring. Sometimes it‚Äôs better.

Patrons sipped their coffee and browsed the holonet to the cheerful tunes.
